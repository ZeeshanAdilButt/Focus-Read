# Privacy Policy for Flow Mate

**Last Updated:** January 17, 2026

## Overview

Flow Mate is a browser extension that helps users read web content and PDF documents faster using RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) technology. This privacy policy explains how Flow Mate handles user data.

## Data Collection

**Flow Mate does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

All text processing happens entirely within your browser. The extension:

- Does NOT collect any personal information
- Does NOT track your browsing history
- Does NOT store any data on external servers
- Does NOT use analytics or tracking tools
- Does NOT share any information with third parties

## How the Extension Works

When you use Flow Mate:

1. **Text Extraction:** When you click "Scan Page" or use "Flow from here," the extension reads text content from the current webpage locally in your browser.

2. **PDF Processing:** When you load a PDF, it is processed entirely within your browser using the pdf.js library. The PDF file never leaves your device.

3. **Settings Storage:** Your preferences (reading speed, colors, font choices) are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. This data stays on your device and is never transmitted elsewhere.

4. **No External Communication:** Flow Mate does not make any network requests to external servers. All functionality works offline after installation.

## Permissions Explained

Flow Mate requires certain browser permissions to function:

- **sidePanel:** To display the speed reading interface
- **activeTab:** To extract text from the page you're currently viewing
- **scripting:** To highlight words on the webpage as you read
- **tabs:** To communicate between the side panel and the webpage
- **contextMenus:** To provide the "Flow from here" right-click option
- **Host permissions (<all_urls>):** To work on any website you choose to read

These permissions are used solely to provide the speed reading functionality and never for data collection.

## Data Security

Since no data is collected or transmitted, there is no data to secure on our end. All information remains on your local device under your control.

## Children's Privacy

Flow Mate does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age.
